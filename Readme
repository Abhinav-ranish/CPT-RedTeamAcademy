# Kali Linux Tools 

This README provides a quick overview of some of the tools I used penetration testing, covering everything from network scanning to brute-forcing and cryptography. For more details on each tool, links to their respective documentation or download pages are provided.

**Note**: This guide assumes that you are using **[Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/docs/installation/)**, a popular Linux distribution for penetration testing and security auditing. Follow the link to install Kali Linux if you haven't already.
